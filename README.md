# Ask Mike

A Command line utility to do stuff

## Why?

Because I write useful code (at least for me), and want to install it in all of my environments

## Getting started

```
npm install -g askmike  # Install globally, not to the project
askmike ip   # Prints your ip address
```

# Available Commands

| Command  | Purpose                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| nabcheck | Check your settings, proxies, .npmrc etc  |
| ip       | Show all ip addresses and interface names |


# Development

## Running the tests

Testing is quite simple atm. Feel free to add test cases, particularly if something is broken.

```
npm run test
```

## Deployment

No need, this is a dev time tool. You don't even need to add it to your project
